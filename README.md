# mazevis

this project seeks to be a resource to learn and implement multitude of maze and pathfinding algorithms through visualizations and descriptions

includes visualizations of various maze generating algorithms such as depth-first search, prims algorithm, aldous-broder algorithm, wilsons algorithm, and kruskals algorithm. path-finding algorithms like a*, dijkstras, and bellman-ford are also included to solve the mazes
